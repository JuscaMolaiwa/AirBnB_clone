# AirBnB Clone Project

The AirBnB clone project involves building a command-line interface (CLI) that enables users to manage objects relevant to an AirBnB-like application. This CLI acts as the groundwork for future development, including the creation of a complete web application with functionalities such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, and API integration.

Command Interpreter

The command interpreter serves as the main interface for interacting with the AirBnB-like application. It allows users to manage objects related to the application through a series of commands entered in the command-line interface.

To start the command interpreter:

- Navigate to the directory containing the Python scripts for the AirBnB project.
- Run the main script responsible for launching the command interpreter. This script is $console.py
- After executing the script, the command interpreter will start, and you'll see a prompt indicating it's ready to accept commands

Exiting: To exit the command interpreter, type quit or use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+D (EOF).
